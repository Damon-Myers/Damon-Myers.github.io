# The Pragmatic Programmer

The Pragmatic Programmer is one of those oft-touted books that has been on the bookshelves of software engineers for decades. It's on the [StackOverflow list of "most influential books"](https://stackoverflow.com/a/1713/5100021) for programmers, and has almost [13,000 reviews on Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4099.The_Pragmatic_Programmer) with an average score of 4.31[^1], outscoring the famous (or infamous) Gang of Four book, [Design Patterns](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/85009.Design_Patterns).

It's really no surprise that it eventually found its way onto my bookshelf as well, but it managed to stay there until I changed commutes and needed a good book to help pass the time.

Perusing the software engineering books in my collection, I found myself turning through the pages of _The Pragmatic Programmer_, enjoying how easy it was to read, as well as the affirmation that came from seeing several of my (somewhat dogmatic) beliefs about programming in a book that has lasted in the industry for so long.

Once I finished the book, however, I was somewhat confused. I had just finished reading a book that programmers freely sling around as a definitive source of "how to be a _good_ programmer", but I had so little evidence to back up the claims that the book made. The book is full of great, albeit dated, examples, and makes nods to industry studies throughout the text, but I couldn't shake the feeling that what I thought were the identifying features of a _good_ software engineer weren't substantive.

As such, I was compelled to start this blog. It provides a good excuse for me to do a more thorough investigation of some chapters that stood out to me. With that, I will have a better idea of what data fuels my beliefs about software engineering, and whether that data is still applicable in the industry today.

All of this isn't to say I didn't enjoy the book. Today, I still think it is a fantastic resource for new developers who need advice on how to continue improving the software they build, as well as intermediate and advanced programmers who need a confidence boost or book to point to while discussing issues with their peers.

I will be referencing specifics from the book in the chapters that follow, so if you're interested in following along I'd recommend purchasing your own copy or borrowing one from a friend.
